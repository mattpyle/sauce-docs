* Ensure you have appropriate administrator permissions
* Successfully [run tests with `saucectl`](/dev/cli/saucectl/#running-tests) on their own before launching from your CI pipeline.

Once you have met the prerequisites, follow the instructions for the CI Tool with which you want to integrate your `saucectl` tests.
